***preamble***

Since 2015 I have been volunteering for [CISV International](http://www.cisv.org), a global organization dedicated to educating and inspiring for peace through building inter-cultural friendship, cooperation and understanding. CISV's peace education has four main content areas: diversity, human rights, conflict and resolution, sustainable development. Every year, it puts the spotlight on one of them and 2017 is CISV's year for human rights. This is the reason why I have been researching and reflecting about this theme for a few months and why I would like to commit myself and my project to human rights.

Rights are invisible. You can neither see them, nor touch, nor hear.
