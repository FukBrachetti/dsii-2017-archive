__***preamble***__

Since 2015 I have been volunteering for [CISV International](http://www.cisv.org), a global organization dedicated to educating and inspiring for peace through building inter-cultural friendship, cooperation and understanding. CISV's peace education has four main content areas: diversity, human rights, conflict and resolution, sustainable development. Every year, it puts the spotlight on one of them and 2017 is CISV's year for human rights. This is the reason why I have been researching and reflecting about this theme for a few months and why I would like to commit myself and my project to human rights.

__***definition***__

Human rights are a set of principles concerned with fairness and equality among people. They identify the most essential freedoms and entitlements we have as human beings. They describe the free and safe life that all people, everywhere, should be able to live. The core of human rights was set in 1948 on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), partly in response to the atrocities of World War II.

__***(in)visible***__

At the most basic level, rights are ideas. Therefore, they are invisible. You can neither see them, nor touch, nor hear. Actually, we rarely even think about human rights because we (luckily) live in a country where they are generally respected. We more often talk about rights when they are missing and even in that case, we do not have a proper knowledge or a clear image regarding countries and communities where they are denied.

A data visualization about human rights would be interesting and useful for CISV's purposes, as well. Indeed, making what we teach and communicate in CISV's programmes visible is a very important part of our "learning-by-doing" approach.

__***statement of purpose***__

When we take human rights for granted, as we generally do, they become invisible to us. What I aim to do by means of this project is making people reflect on the subject. Specifically, I want them to be able to actually see human rights and all the relatives issues again. 

One way to reach this goal would be to simulate a situation where one or more specific rights are denied. Simulation games, indeed, are what we usually do in CISV programmes to make kids understand difficult topics, like this one. Of course, denying a human right, through this project, would be hard and too complicated. What I can do, instead, is to make users think about what they have and other people have not; to make users realize that if they were born in another country, they would not have the same rights; and that what we take for granted is a rare privilege elsewhere. 

__***first things first***__

The first phase of my research was about looking for reliable data regarding missing or denied human rights all over the world. The main issue I came upon was the enormous amount of different kind of existing violations. Therefore, I started researching what could go under the name of 'human rights abuse' and what could not. Of course, there is not a neat line between them, and there are different opinions on the matter. Soon, I came across the question "Are some rights more important than others?". An inspiring answer I found out was the one given by Mausi Segun, Nigerian Researcher at [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org).

__***evaluating human rights' violations***__

The [CIRI Human Rights Data Project](http://www.humanrightsdata.com) provides annual standards-based information about government respect for a broad array of human rights in nearly every country in the world. Founded by David L. Cingranelli, David L. Richards, and K. Chad Clay, CIRI Dataset used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources and was designed for use by scholars and students who seek to test theories about the causes and consequences of human rights violations. It includes information about 202 countries, for the years 1981 to 2011. 
Most of the CIRI indicators are ratings on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows: 0 = frequent violations of this right; 1 = some violations of this right; 2 = no reported violations of this right.
The selection of the particular rights in the CIRI Dataset does not imply that these rights are considered to be more important than other human rights. Rather, these are the rights for which information are reliable and systematically available across time and space. For the purpose of my project, I selected 10 of the rights rated by the CIRI Dataset.

**Extrajudicial Killing** Extrajudicial killings are killings by government officials without due process of law. These killings may result from the deliberate, illegal, and excessive use of lethal force by the police, security forces, or other agents of the state whether against criminal suspects, detainees, prisoners, or others.

**Political Imprisonment** Political imprisonment refers to the incarceration of people by government officials because of: their speech; their non-violent opposition to government policies or leaders; their religious beliefs; their non-violent religious practices including proselytizing; or their membership in a group, including an ethnic or racial group.

**Torture** Torture refers to the purposeful inflicting of extreme pain, whether mental or physical, by government officials or by private individuals at the instigation of government officials. This also includes deaths in custody due to negligence by government officials.

**Freedom of Assembly and Association** It is an internationally recognized right of citizens to assemble freely and to associate with other persons in political parties, trade unions, cultural organizations, or other special-interest groups. This variable indicates the extent to which the freedoms of assembly and association are subject to actual governmental limitations or restrictions (as opposed to strictly legal protections).

**Freedom of Foreign Movement** This variable indicates citizens’ freedom to leave and return to their country.

**Freedom of Domestic Movemtn** This variable indicates citizens’ freedom to travel within their own country.

**Freedom of Speech** This variable indicates the extent to which freedoms of speech and press are affected by government censorship, including ownership of media outlets. Censorship is any form of restriction that is placed on freedom of the press, speech or expression.

**Electoral Self-Determination** This variable indicates to what extent citizens enjoy freedom of political choice and the legal right and ability in practice to change the laws and officials that govern them through free and fair elections.

**Freedom of Religion** This variable indicates the extent to which the freedom of citizens to exercise and practice their religious beliefs is subject to actual government restrictions.

**Worker's Rights** Workers should have freedom of association at their workplaces and the right to bargain collectively with their employers. This variable indicates the extent to which workers enjoy these and other internationally recognized rights at work, including a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; a minimum age for the employment of children; and acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.

__***custom dataset***__

Using parts of Version 2014.04.14 of the CIRI Dataset, I completed my own one, selecting only the ratings of the rights I chose and adding the centroids' coordinates of each country. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hsnSWgK8jHz0BzqtMcSEsTRxp33EVtvDSPcBvoAzpJU/edit?usp=sharing) you can find the online Google Sheet with the full dataset.
