***preamble***

Since 2015 I have been volunteering for [CISV International](http://www.cisv.org), a global organization dedicated to educating and inspiring for peace through building inter-cultural friendship, cooperation and understanding. CISV's peace education has four main content areas: diversity, human rights, conflict and resolution, sustainable development. Every year, it puts the spotlight on one of them and 2017 is CISV's year for human rights. This is the reason why I have been researching and reflecting about this theme for a few months and why I would like to commit myself and my project to human rights.

***definition***

Human rights are a set of principles concerned with fairness and equality among people. They identify the most essential freedoms and entitlements we have as human beings. They describe the free and safe life that all people, everywhere, should be able to live. The core of human rights was set in 1948 on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), partly in response to the atrocities of World War II.

***(in)visible***

At the most basic level, rights are ideas. Therefore, they are invisible. You can neither see them, nor touch, nor hear. Actually, we rarely even think about human rights because we (luckily) live in a country where they are generally respected. We more often talk about rights when they are missing and even in that case, we do not have a proper knowledge or a clear image regarding countries and communities where they are denied.

A data visualization about human rights would be interesting and useful for CISV's purposes, as well. Indeed, making what we teach and communicate in CISV's programmes visible is a very important part of our "learning-by-doing" approach.

***statement of purpose***

When we take human rights for granted, as we generally do, they become invisible to us. What I aim to do by means of this project is making people reflect on the subject. Specifically, I want them to be able to actually see human rights and all the relatives issues again. 

One way to reach this goal would be to simulate a situation where one or more specific rights are denied. Simulation games, indeed, are what we usually do in CISV programmes to make kids understand difficult topics, like this one. Of course, denying a human right, through this project, would be hard and too complicated. What I can do, instead, is to make users think about what they have and other people have not; to make users realize that if they were born in another country, they would not have the same rights; and that what we take for granted is a rare privilege elsewhere. 

***first things first***

The first phase of my research was about looking for reliable data regarding missing or denied human rights all over the world. The main issue I came upon was the enormous amount of different kind of existing violations. Therefore, I started researching what could go under the name of 'human rights abuse' and what could not. Of course, there is not a neat line between them, and there are different opinions on the matter. Soon, I came across the question "Are some rights more important than others?". An inspiring answer I found out was the one given by Mausi Segun, Nigerian Researcher at [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org).

***governments evalutation***

The [CIRI Human Rights Data Project](http://www.humanrightsdata.com) provides annual standards-based information about government respect for a broad array of human rights in nearly every country in the world. Founded by David L. Cingranelli, David L. Richards, and K. Chad Clay, CIRI Dataset is designed for use by scholars and students who seek to test theories about the causes and consequences of human rights violations. The selection of the particular rights in the CIRI Dataset does not imply that these rights are considered to be more important than other human rights. Rather, these are the rights for which information are reliable and systematically available across time and space. It includes information about 202 countries, for the years 1981 to 2011.
