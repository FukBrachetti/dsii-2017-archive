***preamble***

Since 2015 I have been volunteering for [CISV International](http://www.cisv.org), a global organization dedicated to educating and inspiring for peace through building inter-cultural friendship, cooperation and understanding. CISV's peace education has four main content areas: diversity, human rights, conflict and resolution, sustainable development. Every year, it puts the spotlight on one of them and 2017 is CISV's year for human rights. This is the reason why I have been researching and reflecting about this theme for a few months and why I would like to commit myself and my project to human rights.

***definition***

Human rights are a set of principles concerned with fairness and equality among people. They identify the most essential freedoms and entitlements we have as human beings. They describe the free and safe life that all people, everywhere, should be able to live. The core of human rights was set in 1948 on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), partly in response to the atrocities of World War II.

***(in)visible***

At the most basic level, rights are ideas. Therefore, they are invisible. You can neither see them, nor touch, nor hear. Actually, we rarely even think about human rights because we (luckily) live in a country where they are generally respected. We more often talk about rights when they are missing and even in that case, we do not have a proper knowledge or a clear image regarding countries and communities where they are denied.

A data visualization about human rights would be interesting and useful for CISV's purposes, as well. Indeed, making what we teach and communicate in CISV's programmes visible is a very important part of our "learning-by-doing" approach.
