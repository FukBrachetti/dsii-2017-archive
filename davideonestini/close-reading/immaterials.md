# Immaterials: Light painting WiFi 
(Timo Arnall, Jørn Knutsen, Einar Sneve Martinussen, 2012)

***what is***

Time-lapse photographies showing a light-painted graph with blue bars representing the WiFi network present in the exact spot where they are shown. 
The pictures are the result of a light painting that took place in the Grünerløkka area of Oslo, 
Norway.

***how it works***

A 4-meter tall wood stick with 80 leds running the entire length has been carried by the authors of the project around the city of Oslo.
