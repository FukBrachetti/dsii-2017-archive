# Immaterials: Light painting WiFi 
(Timo Arnall, Jørn Knutsen, Einar Sneve Martinussen, 2012)

***what is***

Time-lapse photographies showing a light-painted graph with blue bars representing the WiFi network present in the exact spot where they are shown. 
The pictures are the result of a light painting that took place in the Grünerløkka area of Oslo, 
Norway.

***how it works***

A 4-meter tall wood stick with 80 leds running the entire length has been carried by the authors of the project around the city of Oslo.
The stick was held vertically and the led lights turned on and pulsed according to the strength of the WiFi network in that place and at that moment.
Thanks to a microcontroller fixed onto the stick, the stronger the WiFi signal was, the more lights lit up from the bottom to the top.

The authors took long-exposure photographs and a video of the result.
